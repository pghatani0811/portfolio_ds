# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Linear-Regression-Project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**55%** accuracy](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Logistric-Regression).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Logistric-Regression)

<img src="images/portuguesebank.webp?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**86.9%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Logistric-Regression).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important features.
- Used SMOTE to balance dataset.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Identifying Symptoms of Orthopedic Patients as Normal or Abnormal
](https://github.com/pghatani0811/KNN-NB-Projects)

<img src="images/Orthopedic.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, KNN, NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbor, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbor points. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal
 [**75.81%** accuracy using Naive Bayes algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/KNN-NB-Projects).

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patientâ€™s condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Handwritten Digit Recognisation](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Deep-Natural-Networks)

<img src="images/HandWritten Project.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of hand written digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Nural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**97.7%** using **5** epochs](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Deep-Natural-Networks).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
- Trained model with 8 epochs.
